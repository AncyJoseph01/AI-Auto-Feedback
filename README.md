# ðŸ§  Automated AI Feedback Generator

## Technologies: Python, LLaMA 3.1, Hugging Face Inference API, FastAPI, React

I developed an end-to-end AI-powered system that automatically generates and embeds personalized feedback into student submissions. The tool extracts question-answer pairs from documents and uses the LLaMA 3.1 large language model to produce concise, professional feedback comments for each response. This feedback is inserted directly as in-line comments within the Word file, eliminating the need for tutors to manually review each answer.

The backend was built with FastAPI, handling model prompts, logic, and token management. I integrated Hugging Faceâ€™s Inference API for scalable access to LLaMA, crafting context-aware prompts to maintain a supportive and consistent tone across all feedback. I also implemented logic to generate an overall feedback summary at the top of each document.

While the frontend was kept minimal (React), the projectâ€™s core complexity lay in automating LLM pipelines, document structure parsing, and building reusable prompt frameworks, reflecting my focus and ambition to grow as an AI Engineer.
